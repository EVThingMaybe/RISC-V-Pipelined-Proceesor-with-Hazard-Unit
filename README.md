 RISC-V Pipelined Processor with Hazard Unit Design

1. Introduction
RISC-V is a modular and open Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) known for its simplicity and efficiency. In a pipelined processor, parallel execution of multiple instructions across various stages introduces challenges such as data hazards, control hazards, and structural hazards. The Hazard Unit is a critical component designed to resolve these issues and maintain pipeline correctness and performance.

2. RISC-V Pipelined Processor Overview
2.1 Pipeline Stages
A typical RISC-V 5-stage pipelined processor consists of the following stages:
1.Instruction Fetch (IF): Fetches the instruction from instruction memory.

2.Instruction Decode (ID): Decodes the instruction, extracts opcode, source registers (rs1, rs2), destination register (rd), function codes (funct3, funct7), and immediate values.

3.Execute (EX): Performs ALU operations or computes memory addresses for load/store instructions.

4.Memory Access (MEM): Reads from or writes to data memory.

5.Write Back (WB): Writes results back to the register file.

2.2 Hazard Types and Solutions
      2.2.1. Data Hazards: Occur when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction that has   not completed.
                Solution: Implement a forwarding unit to bypass intermediate results or stall the pipeline if forwarding is not possible.
      2.2.2 Control Hazards: Occur due to branch or jump instructions.
               Solution: Implement pipeline flushing or branch prediction to mitigate penalties.
      2.2.3 Structural Hazards: Rare in modern RISC-V implementations due to well-separated functional units.
3. Hazard Unit Design
The Hazard Unit plays a crucial role in detecting and resolving pipeline hazards. Its primary responsibilities include:
3.1 Data Hazard Detection
    • Detects potential read-after-write (RAW) hazards by comparing source registers (rs1, rs2) of the current instruction with destination registers (rd) of instructions in earlier stages.
    • Outputs control signals to stall the pipeline or forward results from later stages.
3.2 Control Hazard Handling
    • Monitors branch and jump instructions to determine whether a pipeline flush is necessary.
    • Outputs signals to flush or stall the pipeline as required.
3.3 Forwarding Unit
    • Enables forwarding of data from the EX/MEM or MEM/WB stages to the EX stage to resolve data dependencies without stalling.

4. Verilog Design Overview
4.1 Key Modules
The Verilog implementation consists of the following main modules:
    1. Control Unit:
          Decodes the instruction opcode and function codes (funct3, funct7) to generate control signals such as RegWrite, MemRead, MemWrite, and ALUControl.
    2. Pipeline Registers:
          Stores intermediate results and control signals between pipeline stages (IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/MEM, and MEM/WB).
    3. ALU:
          Performs arithmetic and logical operations based on the ALUControl signal.
    4. Hazard Control Unit:
          Detects hazards and outputs stall, flush, and forwarding control signals. Forwarding Unit Directs data from EX/MEM and MEM/WB pipeline registers to the ALU inputs to resolve data hazards.
    5. Data Memory:
          Handles memory read/write operations controlled by MemRead and MemWrite.
